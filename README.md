## Pot Plant Growing Game

### Disney Ideation

#### Dreamer

- Simulate the growth of plants over weeks and days.
- Every plant is unique and grows in its own way.
- Plants are visually exciting and look cool.
- Environmental factors effect plants growth (water, soil quality, sunlight, temperature, pests)
- Choose environmental factors for each plant to effect growth.
- Can grow a set of multiple plants.
- Choose style of pots.
- Persistant browser game: when you return to your plants they are still there, and they've grown taller in your absence.

#### Realist

- Generate a complete plant, and reveal it over time to give the illusion of growth.
- Grow a single plant.
- Draw plants on screen using SVGs so their features can evnetually be changed.
- Pick from a set of interconnecting plant 'tiles', that fit together to give the impression of randomness.
- Frontend which displays the plants.
- Backend which holds the logic to grow the plants.
- Database which holds persistent data of peoples plants.

#### Spoiler

- Can you make procedurally genreated SVGs that look pretty?
- What are the 'variables' that go into generating a plant?
- Can you edit pre-existing SVGs?
- Will this be fun for anyone but you?
- Isn't the fun of plants that they're alive, and not on the computer?
